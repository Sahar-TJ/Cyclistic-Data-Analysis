# Cyclistic-Data-Analysis
Google Data Analytics Capstone Project
This Project is a part of **Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate** offered by **Google** on **Coursera**.

Had to clean the datasets, manipulate and combine all the datasets into 1 making it a dataframe of 3 million rows. From the dataframe, analyzed the most popular days for Cyclistic Bikes to be used by riders, differenciated between the casual riders and members of Cyclistic, learnt about the most popular bikes and the most popular startions from where bikes were picked and dropped off by the Riders.

The visuals helped in recommending the right steps Cyclistic can encourage their casual riders to buy memberships. 

Used all the **5 phases of Data Analysis** process to complete this project.
